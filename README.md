# Cooperative-Multi-Agent-Inverse-Reinforcement-Learning

Implementation of the Archive Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning used for the writing of the master thesis titled  "Cooperative Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Towards Better Modelling of Cooperative Behavior".

For the MA_AIRL algorithm the origibal repository (https://github.com/ermongroup/MA-AIRL) was addaped to the needs of this project while for the MaxEnt algorithm and the AMAIRL implemetation used https://github.com/qzed/irl-maxent as a starting point.
