Implementation of the Archive Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AMAIRL) and Multi-Agent Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-AIRL) algorithms, used in the research for the master thesis titled  "Cooperative Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Towards Better Modelling of Cooperative Behavior".

For the MA_AIRL algorithm the original repository [^1] was adapted to the needs of this project while for the MaxEnt algorithm and the AMAIRL implementation the repository by [^2] was used as a starting point. 
The AMAIRL method was implemented from scratch while the other two algorithms were adapted to the environments used in this research.
